I have completed each of the tasks and have the timeouts working, the forking working, and the alg working. There is only one minor error in my program that I can find which is when you run the executable with -t n, it will add the previous digit at the end of the output for some reason. I tried fixing this but could not find the error. It still has all the correct sets tho aside from that and provides the correct sets when you run the code without -t. Unsure of what happened but that is the only minor error my code has as far as I know. Thank you! -Benjamin Kehe
